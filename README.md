# Restaurant-billing-Database
It's a Assignment for my Database program.
A local pizza shop does not like its current database to track customer orders. Although it does the job, it requires
significant maintenance and itâ€™s antiquated database back end makes it almost impossible to run proper reports. Since
the existing system is a piece of proprietary software, you are required to operate from scratch. They provided you with
a copy of their menu and a receipt as source documents for information.

For the referance see the file named scenario 2. It contains menu and bill.
